# `a2a-card-sign-v01`: Agent Card signature vectors

Layer **C** of the Agent Card canonicalization corpus: which **signatures** a verifier accepts.

| layer | corpus | question |
|---|---|---|
| A | `a2a-jcs-v01` (a2aproject/a2a-tck#228) | RFC 8785 canonicalization and the `signatures` exclusion |
| B | `a2a-jcs-rule1-v01` (a2aproject/a2a-tck#245) | section 8.4.1 rule 1 on bytes, one expectation per resolution |
| C | `a2a-card-sign-v01` (this) | given a signed card, accept or reject |

Layers A and B pin bytes. A card in the wild arrives with a signature, and the verifier has to decide which bytes
that signature covers. This corpus pins that decision.

## Readings

The bytes a card signature covers are read in three ways today:

| reading | what it does | matches |
|---|---|---|
| `rule-1-as-written` | Section 8.4.1 rule 1 on the card as served: a REQUIRED field (proto annotation) stays even at its default value, a field with the `optional` keyword stays when set, any other field at its default value is dropped. Then RFC 8785. | the section's own worked example, which keeps `description: ""` and `skills: []` and omits `extensions: []` |
| `prune-empty` | Empty strings, arrays and objects removed recursively, REQUIRED or not. Then RFC 8785. | a2a-sdk 1.2.1, @a2a-js/sdk 1.3.0 |
| `served-as-is` | The served JSON with `signatures` removed, nothing else. Then RFC 8785. | a2a-go a2acrypto at main 534a60fc |

The generator refuses to write a vector unless `prune-empty` equals the a2a-python and @a2a-js/sdk canonical bytes
and `served-as-is` equals a2a-go's, case by case, so the second and third rows describe the SDKs, not a guess about
them.

In s0 and s1 every card carries every REQUIRED field of `AgentCard`, so Layer B's open point (a REQUIRED field absent
from the input) does not arise there, and on those inputs its `presence-preserving` and `inject-required-defaults`
resolutions both give the `rule-1-as-written` bytes. Group s2 is where it does arise.

## Groups

`s0-control`: one card with no field at its default value, so all three readings give the same bytes.

| id | signer | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| S0-001 | reference | MUST-ACCEPT under every reading |
| S0-002 | a2a-sdk 1.2.1 | MUST-ACCEPT under every reading |
| S0-003 | @a2a-js/sdk 1.3.0 | MUST-ACCEPT under every reading |
| S0-004 | a2a-go main 534a60fc | MUST-ACCEPT under every reading |
| S0-REJECT-005 | reference, card edited after signing | MUST-REJECT under every reading |

These hold whichever way a2aproject/A2A#2122 is settled.

`s1-default-valued`: the control card with one field at its default value. Each case is a pair of vectors, one
signature per distinct canonical form. Under any one reading exactly one vector of the pair is accepted.

| case | vector | accepted under |
|---|---|---|
| `description = ""` (REQUIRED) | S1-001 | rule-1-as-written, served-as-is |
| | S1-002 | prune-empty |
| `skills = []` (REQUIRED) | S1-003 | rule-1-as-written, served-as-is |
| | S1-004 | prune-empty |
| `skills[0].tags = []` (REQUIRED on AgentSkill) | S1-005 | rule-1-as-written, served-as-is |
| | S1-006 | prune-empty |
| `capabilities.extensions = []` (not REQUIRED) | S1-007 | rule-1-as-written, prune-empty |
| | S1-008 | served-as-is |

A nested empty value (`securityRequirements: [{}]`) is left out on purpose: whether an element that becomes empty
collapses is itself part of the #2122 question, and a vector would have to assume the answer.

## Group s2: a REQUIRED field absent from the served JSON

Added after the first sweep. The s0 and s1 files are unchanged byte for byte, so a sweep over those 13 vectors stays
valid. Rule 1 says a REQUIRED field "MUST always be present"; for a field the signer never served, that sentence can be
scoped two ways, and s2 makes the two scopes testable against each other:

| reading | what it does | matches |
|---|---|---|
| `rule-1-served-scope` | rule 1 applied to the fields present in the served JSON; an absent field stays absent | the section's worked example (S2-WE-011), and no SDK as shipped |
| `rule-1-descriptor-scope` | rule 1 applied by walking the AgentCard descriptor; an absent REQUIRED field is emitted at its default (`""`, `[]`, `{}`) | a2a-python at a2aproject/a2a-python#1287 head cdee28e |

On s0 and s1 both scopes give the `rule-1-as-written` bytes. `prune-empty` and `served-as-is` keep their meaning.

| case | vector | accepted under |
|---|---|---|
| `description` absent | S2-001 | rule-1-served-scope, prune-empty, served-as-is |
| | S2-002 | rule-1-descriptor-scope |
| `version` absent | S2-003 / S2-004 | as above |
| `skills` absent | S2-005 / S2-006 | as above |
| `skills[0].tags` absent | S2-007 / S2-008 | as above |
| `defaultInputModes` absent | S2-009 / S2-010 | as above |
| the worked example, served as printed | S2-WE-011 | rule-1-served-scope only |

The generator (`vectors_s2.py`) refuses a case unless `prune-empty` equals a2a-sdk 1.2.1 and @a2a-js/sdk 1.3.0,
`served-as-is` equals a2a-go, and `rule-1-descriptor-scope` equals a2a-python at #1287, byte for byte. The checks are
recorded in `MANIFEST.json` under `s2_checks`.

## Group s3: fields outside the AgentCard schema

Added after a2aproject/A2A#2122 asked how the served-scope sentence treats a field the served JSON carries but the
schema does not define. Section 5.7 says such fields SHOULD be ignored when parsing; it does not say whether a
signature covers them. The s0, s1 and s2 files are unchanged byte for byte. s3 is scored on its own axis
(`"axis": "unknown-fields"` in each vector) against three readings:

| reading | what it does | matches |
|---|---|---|
| `unknown-retain` | served-scope rule 1 on the defined fields; every undefined field kept verbatim where it was served | a2a-go main 534a60fc |
| `unknown-exclude` | every undefined field removed at every depth, then served-scope rule 1 | a2a-sdk 1.2.1, @a2a-js/sdk 1.3.0, a2a-python#1287 cdee28e |
| `unknown-reject` | a card carrying any undefined field is refused | no SDK |

Every s3 card is the s0 control card plus undefined fields, with no defined field at its default value, so the s0 to
s2 readings cannot disagree on the defined fields: each pair differs only in whether the undefined fields are covered.

| case | vector | accepted under |
|---|---|---|
| `url`, `protocolVersion`, `preferredTransport` at the top level (0.3 fields) | S3-001 / S3-002 | unknown-retain / unknown-exclude |
| `provider.legalEntity` | S3-003 / S3-004 | as above |
| `compensation` (an undefined object) | S3-005 / S3-006 | as above |
| `skills[0].costHint` (inside a repeated element) | S3-007 / S3-008 | as above |
| `x-reserved: []` (undefined and empty) | S3-009 / S3-010 | as above |
| S3-002 with `url` replaced after signing | S3-T-011 | unknown-exclude only |

S3-T-011 is the point of the group: under `unknown-exclude` the edited card still verifies, because the edited value was
never covered. The "matches" column is recorded, not assumed: `vectors_s3.py` canonicalizes every case with each SDK
and writes which reading its bytes equal to `MANIFEST.json` under `s3_sdk_forms`.

## Scoring a verifier

`score.py` (beside the generator, no dependencies) takes a verifier's accept/reject verdicts and reports, for each
reading, how many of the 24 s0 to s2 vectors it gets right and how many signatures it accepts that the reading rejects. A
verifier that accepts under two readings at once (a transition policy) is scored the same way: on this corpus it
cannot be conformant to any single reading, because every reading-dependent pair has one vector each reading must
reject. A transition policy therefore has to be declared by the verifier; it cannot be inferred from conformance.
The 11 s3 vectors are scored in a second table against `unknown-retain`, `unknown-exclude` and `unknown-reject`.

## Observed on 2026-10-01

Not part of the expectations; recorded in `MANIFEST.json` under `observed`. Each SDK's own verifier on each served card:

| vector | a2a-python | a2a-js | a2a-go |
|---|---|---|---|
| S0-001 to S0-004 | accept | accept | accept |
| S0-REJECT-005 | reject | reject | reject |
| S1-001, S1-003, S1-005 | reject | reject | accept |
| S1-002, S1-004, S1-006 | accept | accept | reject |
| S1-007 | accept | accept | reject |
| S1-008 | reject | reject | accept |

The observed column follows directly from the readings table: each SDK accepts the vectors tagged with its own
reading. For s2, `MANIFEST.json` records the same three SDKs plus a2a-python at #1287 under `observed.s2`: the three
shipping SDKs accept S2-001, 003, 005, 007 and 009 and reject the even ones; a2a-python at #1287 does the opposite; none
accepts S2-WE-011.

On 2026-10-02, `observed.s3`: a2a-sdk 1.2.1, @a2a-js/sdk 1.3.0 and a2a-python at #1287 accept S3-002, 004, 006, 008,
010 and S3-T-011 and reject the odd ones; a2a-go accepts the odd ones and rejects the rest, S3-T-011 included.

## Key and reproduction

`testkey_jwks.json` holds the public half of a published test key (kid `hs-interop-test-v1`, ES256). The `jku` in
every protected header is an `example.com` placeholder: never fetch it, resolve the key from `testkey_jwks.json` by
`kid`. The private
key is derived from a public phrase given in `MANIFEST.json`, so anyone can re-create it. Reference signatures use
RFC 6979 deterministic ECDSA, so re-running the generator reproduces every reference vector byte for byte; S0-002 to
S0-004 are kept as the SDKs produced them. The key signs test vectors only and is nobody's production key.

Canonical bytes were produced by two independent RFC 8785 implementations, which agree exactly:

- `rfc8785` (PyPI, 0.1.4)
- `gowebpki/jcs` (Go, v1.0.1)

Spec text: a2aproject/A2A `specification/specification.md` at `173695755607` (v1.0.0). REQUIRED set: the
`field_behavior` annotations of `a2a.proto` (details in `MANIFEST.json` under `spec_provenance`).

Generator: `workers/a2a-card-sign/interop-matrix/vectors.py` in ogasurfproject-jpg/horizon-shield, with
`vectors_check.mjs` beside it, an independent WebCrypto check of every hash and signature.

No file here overlaps `a2a-jcs-v01` or `a2a-jcs-rule1-v01`, and nothing depends on the order in which the three
corpora are merged.
